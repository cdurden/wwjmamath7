$PAR
Suppose that a butterfly can fly 82 feet in 4 seconds. A dragonfly can fly 50 feet in 2 seconds. Which can fly faster and by how much?
$BR
\{SECTION_ANS($mc->cmp), $mc->buttons()\}

The question is asking us to compare the speed of the dragonfly to the speed of the butterfly. What are the speeds?

$BR
Speed of the dragonfly: \{SECTION_ANS($unit_rate_a->cmp), $unit_rate_a->ans_rule() \}

$BR
Speed of the butterfly: \{SECTION_ANS($unit_rate_b->cmp), $unit_rate_b->ans_rule() \}
